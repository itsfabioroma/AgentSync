The idea is to allow users to have conversations to AI on a non-linear way, by connecting retangles, arrows and an special \"agent\" block that generates response based on connected nodes. I want you to use UltraContext to handle the storing, retrieval, branchind and editing capabilities of the feature. This will be the consumer demo for UltraContext. Here is a more deep brainstorm on how I thought through this: - Agent block is an special retangle that starts as an empty retangle with a brain icon and turns into a response block (a retangle with inner text that hidratantes as LLM generates response) - To trigger a response of an agent: connect a Retangle block with inner text to an agent block using an arrow. The agent will interpret that as a query. - Responses block supports MD - Responses can be edited, so we should handle messages ideally by index on ultracontext, as message ids will change for all messages after an edit, because context gets copied under the hood - If a query is edited and there is messages after that point, another response will be generated and will output another response block with a new arrow pointed to it. (ultracontext should fork the context at that point). This will allow users to explore new conversation paths. Resources: ./website/docs (for docs on ultracontext and main understanding how it works) ./ultracontext-node (for specifics on the node sdk) ./excalidraw (To see how the repo works and where should we tweak to allow this feature)"}}
