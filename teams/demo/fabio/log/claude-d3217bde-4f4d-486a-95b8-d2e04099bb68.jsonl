Prioritizes \"time to first context\" and progressive disclosure — basics first, depth when needed. --- ## 1. Home / Introduction **Goal:** Explain what UltraContext is in 30 seconds. ### Content - One-liner: \"Context infrastructure for AI agents\" - The problem: Managing conversation history, tool calls, and decision context across agent sessions - The solution: Git-like versioned context that's always recoverable - Key differentiators: - 6 methods, zero config - History is never lost (branching on mutations) - Time-travel and audit built-in ### Tone Hook developers fast. No enterprise fluff. --- ## 2. Quickstart **Goal:** Working code in under 5 minutes. ### Content ```typescript // 1. Install npm install @ultracontext/sdk // 2. Initialize import { UltraContext } from '@ultracontext/sdk' const uc = new UltraContext({ apiKey: 'uc_...' }) // 3. Create context const ctx = await uc.create() // 4. Add messages await uc.append(ctx.id, [ { role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }, { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hi there!' } ]) // 5. Retrieve const { data } = await uc.get(ctx.id) // → Ready to pass to your LLM ``` ### What to cover - Installation (npm/yarn/pnpm) - API key (where to get it, format) - Create → Append → Get flow - Link to full API reference ### What NOT to cover - Versioning, branching (save for concepts) - All method options - Error handling --- ## 3. Core Concepts **Goal:** Build the mental model. This is where we share the \"git-like\" story. ### 3.1 Contexts - What they are: Containers for messages and tool interactions - Each context has a stable ID (`ctx_...`) - Contexts are isolated — no cross-contamination - Use cases: one context per conversation, per agent session, per task ### 3.2 Messages - Standard format: `{ role, content }` — works with any LLM - Each message gets a stable ID and index - Append-only within a version (order preserved) - Can include metadata for your own tracking ### 3.3 Versioning (The Git Mental Model) **This is the key concept to nail.** - Every context starts at version 0 - `append()` adds to current version (no new version) - `update()` and `delete()` create new versions (branching) - Old versions are never lost - You're always reading from latest version unless you specify otherwise **Analogy:** > \"Think of your context like a git branch. Appending messages is like adding new commits. But if you need to change or remove a message, UltraContext creates a new branch — your original history stays intact.\" **Visual:** ``` Version 0 (create) │ ├── append msg1 ├── append msg2 ├── append msg3 │ Version 1 (update msg2) │ ├── msg1 ├── msg2 (modified) ├── msg3 │ Version 2 (delete msg3) │ ├── msg1 ├── msg2 (modified) ``` ### 3.4 Time Travel - Access any version:...
